This folder contains the code to estimate the models and generate the figures associated 
with the influenza/respiratory diseases section of the chapter (full reference in main 
README file).

Each figure is generated by a separate Matlab file, which can be executed in any preferred order. 

The code in "Load_Data.m" is called when the figures are generated.

The Markov Switching model is estimated by STATA using the "do" file named "MSM_Glasgow_Influenza.do".
